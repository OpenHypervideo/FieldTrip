00:01:27.082 --> 00:01:30.520
I live in Prenzlauer Berg and I’m a screenwriter.

2
00:01:31.693 --> 00:01:36.920
When I have to clear my head
or I feel that my stories are stuck,

3
00:01:38.026 --> 00:01:44.600
I often cycle to Tempelhof Field
and look out over the wide expanse of the field.

4
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.720
That works really well for me.

5
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:58.160
It resolves my mental block
and I have thought of wonderful solutions here

6
00:02:00.468 --> 00:02:05.400
that I write down on a little notepad.

7
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.520
And after a cup of coffee in the café on the other side
I cycle back home and think:

8
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.080
God, it’s so nice to have such a huge space here in Berlin.

9
00:03:08.683 --> 00:03:11.360
I used to fly from Tempelhof Airport.

10
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.360
The first time I cycled to the airport,
but then I realised that it’s within walking distance of my street.

11
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.240
So the second time I walked to the airport with my suitcase and checked in.

12
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:33.120
Because of the tense political situation in late 1960,

13
00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:40.920
my father wanted to avoid the land route
and so we flew to Hamburg from Tempelhof.

14
00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:46.320
I was almost 5 years old.

15
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.080
I knew about angels from my granny and I thought they lived in the clouds.

16
00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.600
But I couldn’t see a single angel above the clouds.
That just wasn’t on!

17
00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:07.560
I was so angry, that’s probably why I couldn’t see them.

18
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.280
I was just out for a walk on Tempelhof Field
when it started pouring rain.

19
00:04:25.428 --> 00:04:31.400
I sought refuge in this phone booth and listened to all the stories,

20
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.240
looked at the books and enjoyed the thunderstorm in peace.

21
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.320
Thank you, dear phone booth.

22
00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.800
I come to Tempelhof Field a lot,

23
00:04:47.422 --> 00:04:54.320
it’s such a great place to just spend time
without having to do anything super productive.

24
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.000
You can look around and just enjoy yourself.

25
00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:09.520
That’s really nice about Tempelhof Field.

26
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.560
I just tried out my souped-up e-bike.

27
00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:32.840
At the very start I used to speed along here on a motorbike.

28
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.800
There’s a bit too much police around here,
it’s almost like Heidelberg.

29
00:05:39.453 --> 00:05:45.440
So may the field stay free – or rather become free.
Bye-bye.
