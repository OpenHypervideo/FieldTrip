In September 2017, a Berlin theatre, Volksbühne, invited Boris Charmatz to put on a show on the tarmac of the former airport.  
The choreographer from Rennes staged “Fous de danse”, a participatory dance performance.

1
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.400
We’re walking and we’re searching.

2
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.440
We are searching
for modern dance in the 20th century.

3
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.400
And what we suddenly find is this.

4
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.880

5
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.720
There is an exercise

6
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.240
which was very famous in the 80s
and which we’re going to do now.

7
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.960
It’s a contact exercise.

8
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.480
Choose a partner.

9
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.760
It’s a duet.

10
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.440
This went all over the world
throughout the dance scene and beyond.

11
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.240
And although some of us may have been born in the year 2000,
you may know this exercise.

12
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.280
Come closer, closer...
