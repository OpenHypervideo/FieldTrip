In May 2011, one year after the former airport had been opened to the public, 8000 square metres of Tempelhof Field were allocated to three urban garden projects.
Today, there are around 600 people cultivating the beds.
The exuberant green island is a complex universe interrupting the vastness of the field.
For some, the gardens are a political statement, for others a space for ecological or social experiments:
All gardens are freely accessible and not fenced in.

1
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.560
This is us.

2
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.520
Our sunflower is growing beautifully.

3
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640
Jerusalem artichoke is a kind of sweet potato.

4
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.600
It grows very tall

5
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.240
and has beautiful yellow flowers –
like a small sunflower.

6
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.920
Jerusalem artichoke is a root vegetable,

7
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.120
very easy to grow.

8
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.520
It grows on its own.
Just like potatoes.

9
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.040
The tuber tastes a bit like an artichoke.

10
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.560
It’s not about saving the world in some fancy way
but about saving ourselves.

11
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.760
I call it a self-help project.

12
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.880
In Brooklyn we were in an area
where there are no supermarkets

13
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.720
because everybody is living on social welfare.

14
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.400
And it’s not enough money
to shop in a supermarket.

15
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.040
So the supermarkets closed.

16
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.400
The alternative is that people learn very quickly
how to produce their own food.

17
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.000
In the street.
On their balcony.

18
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.840
And that’s what we’re practising here.

19
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.240
Learning by doing.

20
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.520
The whole idea is that it’s a communal effort,
not an individual one.

21
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.520
You look at what your neighbours are doing.

22
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.040
And as you will see, some do it very well –
really well –

23
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.040
while others are only just learning.

24
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.680
Hey Andrea, how are you?

25
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.680
This is a Genovese pumpkin.

26
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.520
Here, take this.

27
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.840
Is that a blanket?

28
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.640
Yes, it’s for slapping people.

29
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.280
I’m leaving at the end of August.

30
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.200
Everything is open, there is no fence.

31
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.200
And somehow people are very respectful.

32
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.280
Like in a museum.

33
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.040
They usually behave as if they were in an art exhibition.

34
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.240
Sometimes they even feel like
they are attending a “happening”.

35
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.720
It’s very interesting.

36
00:03:31.326 --> 00:03:34.720
I wanted to live near Tempelhof Field

37
00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:40.760
because it’s rare to have such a huge field
with so many possibilities in a city.

38
00:03:44.155 --> 00:03:48.880
And there’s nobody complaining about me sitting in someone’s garden,

39
00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:53.000
someone’s little allotment that has a fence and a lock.

40
00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.920
Instead, you can sit really comfortably
and just mess around a bit.

41
00:04:00.637 --> 00:04:03.280
There are a few shady spots as well.

42
00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:08.400
You can always hear sounds
and you never know where there might be other people...

43
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.480
And suddenly someone gets up who might have been lying down
listening to you jamming the whole time.

44
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.480
We never wanted to have a fence around our gardens.

45
00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:15.960
We aren’t allowed to put one up either, that’s in our contract.

46
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.360
Of course completely free access can be problematic

47
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.120
because not everybody understands
that the vegetables should be left to the people who cultivated them,

48
00:05:36.612 --> 00:05:41.720
who planted them, watered them, looked after them for months.

49
00:05:43.078 --> 00:05:48.080
Instead people come and think anyone can help themselves,

50
00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:52.520
do whatever they want and take whatever they want.

51
00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:59.400
In that sense, we are constantly having to educate people.

52
00:06:19.052 --> 00:06:23.960
Last year we were very happy
because we had one radish to share between four of us.

53
00:06:24.692 --> 00:06:28.480
It was our first radish and we were delighted with it.

54
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.280
It’s just nice to see things grow and then be able to eat them,
even if we don’t harvest much.

55
00:06:39.558 --> 00:06:43.480
It’s fun to be doing something together.

56
00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:46.600
You can’t take it too seriously.

57
00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:51.680
Sometimes the vegetables disappear
because people just think they’re free.

58
00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:56.280
And that’s ok, but it just means you can’t take the whole thing too seriously.

59
00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:58.560
That’s how I see it.
