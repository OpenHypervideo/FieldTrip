In the summer of 1948, the Soviets blocked all land and water routes to West Berlin.
The Western Allies’ response was to bring supplies to the city by air.
The Berlin Airlift lasted from 24th June 1948 until 12th May 1949. 
Horst Bert Molkenbuhr spent five years in a Nazi re-education camp as a child 
because his family was close to the left-wing Social Democratic Party. He tells us a story that is rarely mentioned in the usual reports about the airlift.
In 1949, thousands of teenagers spent their summer holidays on Tempelhof Field assisting the Allies.
He was one of them.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.600


2
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.680


3
00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.440


4
00:01:01.022 --> 00:01:05.080


5
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.840
The atmosphere was very strange at first.

6
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.680
After all, the pilots were the same men

7
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.160
who had bombed our cities.

8
00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.200


9
00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:42.280


10
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.880


11
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.680


12
00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:58.560


13
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.000
The thing was that the Americans were incredibly afraid of German men.

14
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.640
They thought if they had given them a tin of vegetables
they would have built a machine gun out of it.

15
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.920
That’s why no German men were allowed into Tempelhof Airport.

16
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.960
Each regiment in Berlin was tasked
with founding a youth club.

17
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.520
One fine day

18
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.440
they asked us if we would be willing
to unload coal...

19
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.400
We all stood up as one.

20
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.560
Around 900 to 1000 young people
from the 21 clubs.

21
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.720
We were on duty for 24 hours

22
00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:13.880
and got one meal,
just like the one the Air Force got.

23
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.120
Of course that was sensational for our families,
having one less mouth to feed.

24
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.480
We were starving at the time.

25
00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:24.800
It was a big metal bowl with five indentations:

26
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.080
For soup,

27
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.600
potatoes, meat,

28
00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:31.600
custard.
Everything was in there.

29
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:34.720
Everybody got to eat their fill.

30
00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:37.600
If necessary you got seconds.

31
00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:40.520
That was a dream come true.

32
00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.600
Everything was just about survival back then.

33
00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.000
My mother...

34
00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.680
My father died in Russia.

35
00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:57.200
My mother had three children

36
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.640
and her mother to look after...

37
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.880
She didn’t earn enough for us to be able to buy the food we needed.

38
00:04:04.523 --> 00:04:09.280
That’s why we appreciate how good we have it today...
apart from our health.

39
00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:32.320
That’s where the bags were.

40
00:04:32.908 --> 00:04:34.960
They were lifted out,
then brought to the door here

41
00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:36.920
and thrown out of the door.

42
00:04:37.087 --> 00:04:40.160
The truck almost reached the lower edge.

43
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.840
And on the truck there were always six to eight boys.

44
00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:50.693
They took the bags

45
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.440
and packed them towards the front
until the plane was empty.

46
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.000
It seemed like a miracle to us

47
00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:36.040
that there were not more accidents.

48
00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.000
The way they were flying here

49
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:42.360
and the way they were landing and taking off...
It was incredible.

50
00:05:43.578 --> 00:05:45.800
They were handling their machines so well:

51
00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.400
The plane came to a halt, the hatch opened, the guy fell down
and was already asleep.

52
00:05:52.045 --> 00:05:55.920
The Americans were so free and casual,
that was something we admired.

53
00:05:56.106 --> 00:06:00.120
We were still used to
someone bellowing orders at us.

54
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:02.880
At school the teachers would still beat us.

55
00:06:28.672 --> 00:06:31.200
Reports about the airlift

56
00:06:31.882 --> 00:06:34.560
never talk about the fact

57
00:06:35.646 --> 00:06:39.720
that we unloaded the planes
in the first couple of months.

58
00:06:41.857 --> 00:06:45.680
I have never understood why we were never mentioned.
