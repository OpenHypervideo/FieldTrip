Kübra Gümüşay is a journalist. 
The feminist author’s main topics are immigration, 
society, digitalisation and Islam. 
The initiative “Die Offene Gesellschaft” (“The open society”) developed in 2016 as a reaction to the 500,000 applications for asylum that had been made in Germany the previous year.
In 2018, Kübra Gümüşay is a guest speaker at the initiative’s annual picnic.

1
00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:56.360
Many people have withdrawn from public discourse
because it has become so toxic and hardened,

2
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.590
because it involves so much provocation and hatred.

3
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:06.000
And so I ask myself:
Where can we still meet up and reflect together?

4
00:01:06.757 --> 00:01:13.644
Where can we come up with completely new visions
and also share thoughts that are stupid or unfinished?

5
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:20.148
And if we have no spaces for these discussions
then we can’t shape the future,

6
00:01:20.148 --> 00:01:22.640
we are nothing but reactionary forces

7
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.800
that just become more and more hardened and homogenous
as the years go by.

8
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:28.560
Thank you.

9
00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:53.240
Unemployment and the distribution of wealth
are topics that we discuss far too little in Germany.

10
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:57.440
We are constantly talking about refugees, Islam, religion, identity...

11
00:01:57.641 --> 00:02:00.080
Am I too fast?

12
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.560
What is wrong with states that can’t react to something like this?

13
00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:16.360
Why do we have an international community,
why do we have international alliances if they don’t react?

14
00:02:20.553 --> 00:02:23.960
I am happy for such an initiative to happen in a field,

15
00:02:24.152 --> 00:02:29.100
out in the open, in the sunshine, at a huge table

16
00:02:30.888 --> 00:02:35.640
and with an open society actually happening around us.

17
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.960
In Hamburg, I lived by a big, busy crossroads.

18
00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:22.920
One day a water pipe broke and the whole street was closed off.

19
00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:28.560
Suddenly you could see how much space there is
when it’s not taken up by cars.

20
00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:37.240
With the cars gone, people started to picnic in the street,
to drink beer and make music.

21
00:03:39.074 --> 00:03:42.080
Cars take up so much living space

22
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.600
just like planes would have done here,
and now we have that space.

23
00:03:54.764 --> 00:04:00.560
Usually if there is open space in a big city
it’s all thought through and finished.

24
00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:04.240
What surprises me here is that it’s so unfinished.

25
00:04:04.757 --> 00:04:11.680
I think that shows a lot of serenity within society
which is also unfinished and needs creative space.

26
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.160
It’s very symbolic and surprising

27
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.640
for a city like Berlin where each square metre is fought over,

28
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.680
to have so much space that is not formalised
or planned or built on.

29
00:04:37.534 --> 00:04:43.120
Berlin can count itself lucky to have such a strong civil society.

30
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.560
That’s not the case everywhere in Germany.

31
00:04:46.761 --> 00:04:50.280
It also means a certain responsibility

32
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.480
and it’s great when the people of Berlin
can have a positive impact on the rest of the country.
