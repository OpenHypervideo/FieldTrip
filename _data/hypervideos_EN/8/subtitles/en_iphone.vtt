Halina W. is back on Tempelhof Field for the first time since 1945. She has travelled from the Polish city of Łódź together with her son.
In March 1945, the Nazis put her to work in Tempelhof Field as a forced labourer.
Around 3000 people were forced to work here during the Third Reich.

1
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.440
This place is very busy.

2
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.640
That’s true.

3
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.480
A lot of people.

4
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.400
They all do whatever they want.

5
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.240
There are bins here and they
are eating next to the bins.

6
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.760
I find that kind of inappropriate.

7
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.120
I’m eager to see what the Germans
are going to do with the refugees.

8
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.440
Do you think they have residence permits already?

9
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.240
It looks as if they
have been here for a while.

10
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.520
As if they are settled here.

11
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.160
I admire Chancellor Merkel.

12
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.640
Because she took in the most refugees.

13
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.920
She is very courageous.

14
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.200
And she didn’t change
her decision.

15
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.720
Even though she was criticised strongly for it.

16
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.000
She has a place in my heart, Mrs. Merkel.

17
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.760
You love everybody anyway.

18
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.200
This is a free society now.

19
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.480
When we were clearing the rubble here

20
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.520
there were prisoners of war in their uniforms everywhere,
Frenchmen and Italians.

21
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.960
I came and I
followed the orders.

22
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.720
I had a pickaxe
and I cleared the rubble.

23
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.400
I wasn’t even 15 years of age.

24
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.560
The other girls
who were brought here with me from Velten Camp

25
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.880
were spread all over the field.

26
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.040
I had wooden shoes that were open at the back.

27
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.160
We weren’t dressed for the cold or for this kind of work.

28
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.920
We always wanted to stay together to warm each other.

29
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.240
The orders were: Work! Don’t do that!
Look here! Look away!

30
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.720
We had to obey and be quiet.

31
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.600
The airports were being bombarded
with the biggest bombs.

32
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.680
They made huge, huge craters in the ground.

33
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.640
Day and night the bombs were falling.

34
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.120
Day and night.

35
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.440
We hid in the craters
when there was an air-raid alarm.

36
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.760
We waited for the attack to pass
and then we went back to work.

37
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.680
If I had someone to support my other arm, that would be helpful.

38
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.800
Hold on to me.

39
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.480
Our mother always spared us children this story.

40
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.680
We knew that she was a forced labourer.

41
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.240
I think it is good
that she didn’t think of it constantly

42
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.480
and that she didn’t pass this on to us.

43
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.000
She didn’t burden our childhood
with stories from the war.

44
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.800
People are free here.

45
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.960
So many nationalities coming together and having fun.

46
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.120
That’s the way it should be.

47
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.480
My youth was lost...

48
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.760
We were just waiting
for the work day to end.

49
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.920
For the order
to go home.
