INTRO
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:16.000 line:-10 position:50% align:middle size:100%
September 2004.
Before the airport closed down, people stood by the airport fence on Oderstrasse every day. Some waited for hours as the planes took off and landed less and less frequently.
What was on their minds?

1
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.440
Technology is just amazing...

2
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.440
Here you don’t think about anything except freedom,
you feel completely free.

3
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:57.880
It’s great.

4
00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:02.760
When I’m sitting here,
everything seems alright with the world.

5
00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:12.240
Behind the fence you have to deal with other people,
talk to them, the usual.

6
00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:19.360
Nobody is bothering me here.
I just sit, watch and think.

7
00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:33.880
He’s passing for the fourth time already.

8
00:02:36.794 --> 00:02:40.280
As if anyone was going to hijack planes here at this stage.

9
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.120
That one is taking off from up there now.+

10
00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:26.000
Then it’ll disappear.

11
00:03:40.473 --> 00:03:42.960
...blowing out toxic fumes.

12
00:03:47.184 --> 00:03:50.360
Damn you!

13
00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:08.920
When you pass an airport like this on your way home,
at first you just gawk at it.

14
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.480
I’ve never been to Majorca or anything...

15
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.600
Humans can’t fly after all.
I’m scared of flying as well.

16
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.440
But yeah, an airport is for dreaming, too,
even though they usually just crash.

17
00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:31.840
At the end of the day
it’s no different from going back and forth on the tram,

18
00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:36.320
it’s all just a question of what you’re used to.

19
00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:56.920
It’s all so uncertain.

20
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.400
You wouldn’t dare to get in.

21
00:05:04.518 --> 00:05:09.320
I’ll go on a train, but not on an airplane.

22
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:12.800
I’m afraid of that...

23
00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.440
Because I’ve never flown on a plane,
that’s just it.

24
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:23.240
Some people get in, just like that...

25
00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:29.520
And others are afraid.

26
00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:34.040
Lots of people are afraid.

27
00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:46.160
I noticed that she likes all the noise.

28
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.440
So I often come here to get her to sleep.

29
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.880
Always at the times when they take off.

30
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.480
For example at 7 and at 12
there are planes landing or taking off.

31
00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:08.640
Lots take off when the work day is over.

32
00:06:09.258 --> 00:06:13.920
And I always try to be here at those times.

33
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.200
Above all, I love planes.
That’s part of the reason.

34
00:06:23.377 --> 00:06:25.560
I also look at them myself.

35
00:06:28.636 --> 00:06:32.000
And when they take off I dream of going somewhere else.

36
00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:35.520
For example to Italy,
my home country.

37
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.840
Unfortunately we only go once a year,
but by car and not by plane.

38
00:06:41.403 --> 00:06:47.760
We’re a big family, two children, a wife,
so it’s cheaper to go by car.
