Farzad H. fled from Afghanistan.
In summer 2015 he moved into the emergency accommodation in Hangar 5 of the former airport.

1
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.160
In our house in Afghanistan
we had three rooms.

2
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.280
One bathroom, the toilet was separate.
It was an old house.

3
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.720
It was about 5 to 10 minutes
from our garden.

4
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.720
In our garden there was
a small well.

5
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.360
It had an engine in it
which pumped the water up,

6
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.800
and that’s how we watered the trees

7
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.600
and sprayed each other with water.

8
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.320
That was a lot of fun.

9
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.720
I never thought about Germany.

10
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.720
I never thought I would suddenly
not be in Herat anymore, but here.

11
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.720
My father got cancer
and he died.

12
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.520
My mother and I remained.

13
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.080
After a while she developed a heart condition.

14
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.200
Then she died as well.

15
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.040
And I remained there by myself.

16
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.720
At the social welfare office they registered us
and gave us an ID card.

17
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.680
I was given an address
and told to go there.

18
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680
Tempelhof.

19
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.200
If I was to go back to Afghanistan,
my life would definitely be in danger.

20
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.960
I don’t know what is going to become of me in the future.

21
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.920
Or what is going to happen tomorrow or in one hour.

22
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.400
My life is up in the air
because my application for refugee status was refused.

23
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.240
Did you often fly kites in Afghanistan?

24
00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:51.560
Yes, on the roof.
And on a big square.

25
00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:59.160
I have lots of dreams.
Staying here,

26
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.560
renting a flat
that I pay for myself.

27
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.920
You don’t know what’s going to happen.
I don’t know if these wishes will come true.
