In 2017, a so-called “Courage Run” took place on Tempelhof Field.
It was an event against the stigmatisation of depression and mental health issues.

1
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.880
I try to get out of the wheelchair.
They took off my leg two years ago.

2
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.600
In any case,
I try to do up to 2 kilometres on the walking sticks.

3
00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:56.840
It’s really good for the mind,
walking is something wonderful.

4
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.440
I can see the finish line already, good.
The goal is in sight.

5
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.400
I have a quote in my flat:

6
00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:14.120
If you fight you might lose,
if you don’t you have already lost.

7
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.480
Berlin!

00:01:58.697 --> 00:01:59.697
9,

11
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.120
10!

12
00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:02.960
Fantastic!
