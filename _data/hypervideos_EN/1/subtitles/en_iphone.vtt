Mustafa Altıoklar is a filmmaker who fled Turkey because he had protested against the ruling party. 
He has been living in Berlin since 2015.
His colleague and fellow protester Şebnem Sönmez is visiting him.

1
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.800
At first they wanted to put buildings here.

2
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.160
But the people were against it, they didn’t let it happen.

3
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.640
When the airport was closed 10 years ago,
they wanted to build a lot.

4
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.960
Ah, I see.
Things like shopping centres and town houses.

5
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.040
That was the plan,
but civil society...

6
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.880
... didn’t allow that to happen?
- Exactly.

7
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.760
Bravo!

8
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.360
Imagine a place like this in Istanbul.

9
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.440
They would just build skyskrapers here,
nothing else.

10
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.960
Does nature even exist there anymore?

11
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.400
It’s terrible what you went through in Gezi Park.

12
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.520
But it did a lot of good for us as well.

13
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.040
Of course.

14
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.720
Even though it damaged us,
it is good that we were part of it.

15
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.000
It really led to people from all over the country
being inspired by the issue

16
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.200
and shouting the slogan: Everywhere is Taksim!
Everywhere is resistance!

17
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.920
Is that Çarşı?

18
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.800
Çarşı!

19
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.080
That’s incredible!

20
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.120
Eva, you’ve gotta shoot this.

21
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.680
Eva, you’ve gotta shoot this.

22
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
To encounter that here...

23
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.200
while we are talking about Gezi.

24
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.200
I want to be in the picture, too!

25
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.280
Am I in it?

26
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.800
Of course you’re in it!

27
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.360
I want a picture as well.

28
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.040
-Isn’t that nice!
-Very nice!

29
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.040
They’re all our friends.

30
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.880
The leaders of Çarşı!

31
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.880
And if Çarşı hadn’t been in Gezi...

32
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.440
Gezi would never have been as successful as it was.

33
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.720
...50 30 5

34
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.320
We are now calling the leader of Çarşı.

35
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.520
Cem, brother!

36
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.920
I am well, brother.
How are you?

37
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.440
Guess what happened!

38
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.400
We were walking, walking, walking...

39
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.520
and suddenly we saw the flag of Çarşı.
Here, brother!

40
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.000
Yes, really.

41
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.480
How could that be?
Who hung it up here?

42
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.600
Is there a Çarşı Berlin?

43
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.680
There is.

44
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.200
Çarşı Berlin must have done that.

45
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.800
Oh right, there’s someone sitting next to me.

46
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.840
Tell him that we’re in Tempelhof.

47
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.680
If you want, you can talk to him...

48
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.520
After we buried my dad
I left the country.

49
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.000
There was an arrest warrant and complaints to the police.

50
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.280
You know these things yourself.

51
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.680
I can’t work there anymore,
they won’t let me work.

52
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.000
That’s why I left.
At the moment I’m here.

53
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.200
I always had trouble with the police there

54
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.440
and that’s why I’m not coming back.
The truth is, I can’t come back.

55
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.800
The Gezi protests showed that
when we act together,

56
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.320
the state is confronted with an invincible force.

57
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.680
It was a new experience for the young generation.

58
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.120
And we experienced them in a new way.

59
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.840
The young people were saying:

60
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.480
You thought we were apolitical.

61
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.080
But we’re not apolitical,
you just didn’t understand our politics.

62
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.960
And they were completely right.

63
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.320
We realised that their generation doesn’t just
think locally.

64
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.400
Exactly.

65
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.240
But maybe they want to live freely, like the Amazons.

66
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.000
We don’t know that.

67
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.160
That would be great. In my opinion
the world will be saved by Amazons.

68
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.840
We need oestrogen.

69
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.080
We need a giant oestrogen pump
in order to save the world.

70
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.720
I agree from the bottom of my heart.

71
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.640
Exactly: Amazons!

72
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.280
We really have to
make a film about Gezi.

73
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.640
But is that even possible?

74
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.160
You could shoot it here.
