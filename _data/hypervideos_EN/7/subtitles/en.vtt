00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.320
There are lots of problems in Berlin,
the population is growing,

2
00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:28.280
people are losing their flats
or can no longer live where they want,

3
00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:30.840
small businesses are losing their traditional location.

4
00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:38.760
The media talk a lot about these problems,
but there are few proposals for a solution.

5
00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:43.960
The solutions I see are only ever piecemeal:

6
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.280
Building on an allotment garden here,
putting up a new skyskraper there.

7
00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:52.480
But I’m not seeing an overall concept.

8
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.600
We have to develop a vision for Berlin

9
00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:05.120
of what we want the city to look like in 50 or 100 years.

10
00:01:05.652 --> 00:01:08.920
I don’t even know of any vision for the city in 5 to 10 years.

11
00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:12.080
And that bothers us.

12
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.440
Should land even be in private ownership?

13
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.400
And if all real estate is owned by 10% of the people,
what about the other 90%?

14
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.960
Do they just live there as guests?
Under what conditions?

15
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.240
Looking at it like that,
you can see that the issue is hugely problematic.

16
00:01:47.928 --> 00:01:53.440
There is someone who can decide,
who can charge rent or terminate a lease.

17
00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:58.080
It’s a fundamental question that is never asked.

18
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.200
A pilot project on Tempelhof Field could change that.

19
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:08.200
It could be in the form of a lease agreement that runs for 99 years.

20
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.000
I think that would be enough to attract an investor
to build a house here subject to certain conditions.

21
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:24.200
This model would remove the increase in land value
which we have seen for the last 1000 years.

22
00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:29.680
Rents would be indexed to the cost of living.

23
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.160
This is a really important point.

24
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.957
It means if I move here and retire in 10 years,

25
00:02:34.957 --> 00:02:41.190
I know that I'll still be able to afford my flat
because pensions are indexed as well.

26
00:03:02.308 --> 00:03:08.440
The basic idea is to create a ground floor of 6 by 20 metres for all houses

27
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.778
which could be used as a multifunctional room.

28
00:03:13.017 --> 00:03:17.600
It could be a space for various associations,
for all kinds of projects.

29
00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:20.800
The houses would be on the edge of the field

30
00:03:21.062 --> 00:03:28.277
so as not to ruin the fantastic free space,
the vastness that we have here,

31
00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:31.440
but to enfold and enrich it.

32
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.720
I only know city centres that are becoming emptier

33
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.440
because of expense office rents,
because of people who live partly in New York, partly in Shanghai,

34
00:03:46.072 --> 00:03:52.200
who have so much money that they can afford huge apartments
where they might spend six weeks a year.

35
00:03:55.355 --> 00:04:02.320
But they don’t fill the city as inhabitants with social obligations and social needs.

36
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.680
They don’t take part.

37
00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.760
What do you make of the referendum result
against building on the field?

38
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.920
We have the great freedom to be able to rethink things at any time.

39
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.360
If we make the same decision again,
that’s totally fine,

40
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.440
but if we make a different decision,
that’s ok as well.

41
00:04:46.358 --> 00:04:49.560
I want to be for something rather than against something,

42
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:53.880
I want to think positively and have a vision.

43
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.151
And everybody can take part in that.

44
00:04:56.151 --> 00:05:00.480
In Berlin everybody is so used to fighting for their idea,
for environmentalism or economic liberalism,

45
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.861
instead of doing something that is both
and from which both sides can benefit

46
00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:08.560
because there isn’t just one single viewpoint.
