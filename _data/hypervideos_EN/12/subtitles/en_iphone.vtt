In 2017, temporary accommodation for 1000 refugees
was built on Tempelhof Field – the so-called Tempohomes.
At the start, it was mainly Syrian men who lived in the prefabs. They had fled the war or the risk of conscription into the army. With the rising number of asylum seekers in Germany, getting permission for their families to join them became increasingly difficult.
Mansour A. has been living in the Tempohomes since 2018, waiting for his family.

1
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.480
In Syria, my neighbours and I were constantly visiting each other.

2
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.600
At the weekend, after work, for lunch,
we often went for walks together...

3
00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:00.440
I came into this accommodation
which is like a separate society.

4
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.360
How do I get out of this isolation?
I don’t know.

5
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.080
This is really weighing on me emotionally.

6
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.520
I don’t want to sit here and live on social welfare.

7
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.880
It’s important to me to take part in the labour market.

8
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.640
That’s how I was raised.

9
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.840
I’ve developed a lot of health problems from sitting around so much.

10
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.080
I want to work to feel that I exist.

11
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.680
I was well established in my life in Syria.

12
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.160
I was working as a chef in hotels and restaurants.

13
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.480
But the war turned everything upside down.

14
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.920
Like a bomb that explodes.

15
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.360
It changed everything, changed it incredibly.

16
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.720
Who does the other packet belong to?

17
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.520
It’s ours. But it’s empty.

18
00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.800
Why don’t you throw it out?

19
00:03:59.922 --> 00:04:01.240
I can throw them all out.

20
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.000
I meant, you should just throw out the empty packet.

21
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.240
We are 4 people and we get on well.

22
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.640
It’s important to get on so you don't have any problems.

23
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.240
The most important thing is cleanliness.

24
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.640
Cleanliness is sacred to us.
Everybody has to respect the rules.

25
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.360
I was walking down the street with my wife

26
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:31.280
when a bomb exploded less than 100 metres from us.

27
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.560
My wife was pregnant at the time.

28
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:49.680
I was afraid something would happen to her and the baby because of the panic.

29
00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:02.000
Then I thought: If I had gone out on the street
just two minutes earlier,

30
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.080
the bomb would have hit us.

31
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.160
I was very shaken by that thought.

32
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.840
That’s why I made the decision to leave.

33
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.080
My wife said: “No, I don’t want to come.”

34
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.680
“I’m worried that something bad will happen
to the foetus on the way.”

35
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.280
“We would regret that until the end of our life.”

36
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:55.840
Two months after I left, my wife had our first child.

37
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.600
She gave birth to a beautiful daughter and I was very happy.

38
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:12.200
I haven’t seen my family for three years and six months.

39
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.400
My daughter only knows me through video, WhatsApp and Messenger.

40
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:33.800
The Germans are nice, good people, but they are careful.

41
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.160
I wish that they could discover us sometime

42
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:48.840
and that we could be contact with one another – even if it is only superficial.
