00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.360
Hold on to the handlebar so you don’t roll away.
That’s it.

2
00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:23.240
Now you just step on while keeping your balance.

3
00:00:25.397 --> 00:00:27.160
Ok. And then you said to drive left.

4
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.240
Exactly.

5
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:33.080
Did I mention that I have a terrible sense of balance?

6
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.560
I’ve been living in Berlin for 10 years,
but this is my first time on Tempelhof Field.

7
00:01:01.273 --> 00:01:04.400
And I have to say it is cool when the sun is shining.

8
00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:07.320
Whether you need it is a different question.

9
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:11.080
We have a family office in Berlin.

10
00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:14.960
We invest in real estate, mainly apartments,

11
00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:20.280
and advise foreign investors
on their property purchases here.

12
00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:24.117
They’re all very interested in the Berlin market

13
00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:28.760
because they see a shortage and rents have risen enormously.

14
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Why did they rise? Not because people are buying property here,
but because there isn’t enough housing.

15
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.600
That’s the main problem for people in Berlin,
even with good jobs they can’t find a place to live.

16
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.960
And if you’re not earning much or you’re unemployed,
it’s even harder.

17
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.200
So we need more housing in Berlin.

18
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.120
It is really great here, it’s not how I imagined Tempelhof Field.

19
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.760
But it’s also great when you have a place to live.

20
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.960
I read that if everything was built on,
you could have 25.000 flats here.

21
00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:17.000
We probably need 200.000 flats in Berlin,
so I would build on most of it:

22
00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:23.000
Even if you only built on 6/7,
you'd still have open space as big as the Theresienwiese in Munich.

23
00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:25.880
That’s where Octoberfest happens every year.

24
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:31.200
That would be awesome as well: Octoberfest in Berlin,

25
00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.080
just in June so it doesn’t collide with the one in Munich.

26
00:02:35.793 --> 00:02:38.920
Would be lots of fun,
would bring in lots of money for the city.

27
00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.280
But doing nothing is not a good option.

28
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.200
This is meant to be a nature reserve, it’s a joke.

29
00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:02.880
I found a quote by anthropologist Friedrich Naumann from 1897:

30
00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.920
“There is no greater contrast than coming onto Tempelhof Field from Berlin.

31
00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:15.600
It is a steppe in the middle of civilisation
where steppe life develops as soon as the sun comes out.

32
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.800
Nowhere in Germany is there a similar spectacle.

33
00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:23.320
Countless women and children emigrate from the stone streets
to lie on the steppe.

34
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.320
They take everything, prams, bedding, field chairs, balls and spades.

35
00:03:29.184 --> 00:03:31.240
On the steppe the city children experience freedom.

36
00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:34.520
They have the vast sky above them and a vast space around them.

37
00:03:34.835 --> 00:03:38.880
On fine days, there are thousands sitting on the ground
between Rixdorf and Schöneberg.”

38
00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:41.600
1897.

39
00:03:42.344 --> 00:03:43.880
What does vastness mean to you?

40
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.440
Waste, luxury.

41
00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:50.320
It’s nice to sit here on a sunny Sunday,

42
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.240
but the housing shortage has become even more acute in the last 5 years.

43
00:03:55.675 --> 00:04:03.040
If you consider the problems then it’s irrelevant
whether there is a vastness here that you can relax in.

44
00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:07.800
There are lots of other ways to relax.

45
00:04:12.944 --> 00:04:17.360
Can you give me an example of how things work with foreign investors?

46
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.880
They are people who want to invest their money in a save haven
such as Germany.

47
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.480
And they have heard that there’s money to be made in Berlin real estate,

48
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.600
that there’s demand, that there’s a shortage of living space which leads to rising prices.

49
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:56.720
We live in Europe.
Why should someone from abroad not buy a house here?

50
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.720
It’s an endorsement of the city as well.

51
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.640
But people demonise speculators who just want to buy a house and then sell it again...

52
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.480
I don’t see that so negatively.

53
00:05:13.928 --> 00:05:17.640
Who does Berlin belong to?

54
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.400
For affordable rents - Save our city

55
00:05:27.318 --> 00:05:29.280
Solidarity against rent sharks

56
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.160
Lower rents for more diversity

57
00:05:47.924 --> 00:05:53.200
The fact that small neighbourhood shops can no longer afford rents
has nothing to do with rent costs.

58
00:05:59.157 --> 00:06:01.800
Why shouldn’t I build hotels? We need tourists in Berlin.

59
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.440
Does it impact rents if I build a hotel in Kreuzberg?

60
00:06:07.863 --> 00:06:09.480
I don’t think so.
