From 1952 to 1961, thousands of people
fled East Germany every month.
The only safe route between West Berlin
and the rest of West Germany was by air.
In 1956, 11-year-old Brigitte Jerate-Kammermeier
also used this route to flee the GDR.

1
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.360
This is where you taxied along on the way to freedom.

2
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.840
Berlin was still close to home,

3
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.800
but when we went to West Germany, that was a real turning point:

4
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.280
Getting onto the plane and leaving,

5
00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:39.080
knowing that you wouldn’t be able to come back.

6
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.920
Berlin was divided and we felt that everywhere.

7
00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:09.960
You are now leaving the British sector, the American sector,
then there was the Soviet occupation zone.

8
00:01:15.218 --> 00:01:17.320
My mother was a war widow.

9
00:01:17.938 --> 00:01:22.160
Somehow she managed to eke out a living,
but she didn’t get a pension,

10
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.720
she had great difficulty finding any sort of work.

11
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.960
It was life at subsistence level.

12
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.200
And of course she blamed the system as well and opposed it publicly,

13
00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:41.800
which obviously attracted the attention of the Stasi and the police.

14
00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:47.200
She also helped other people to flee

15
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840
and that didn’t go unnoticed in our little town.

16
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:56.760
She started to be considered a flight risk herself
and they took away her ID card.

17
00:02:00.952 --> 00:02:04.040
In 1956 she decided she had to leave,

18
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.320
to offer a better future to her children

19
00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:15.040
and also because she did feel that her life and liberty were threatened.

20
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.760
The great difficulty was leaving the GDR when you had no ID.

21
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.440
You couldn’t pass the border at the urban railway station at Friedrichstrasse.

22
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:34.800
Since my mother no longer had her ID,
she procured an ID card from some other woman.

23
00:02:35.672 --> 00:02:41.280
We entered the train separately.
My brother and I sat apart, my mother sat behind us.

24
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.160
Then came the last check before West Berlin.

25
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.480
The People’s Police went through the carriages,
looked at the passengers and asked some for ID.

26
00:02:53.338 --> 00:02:57.240
This last check was the absolutely crucial moment.

27
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.240
When the policemen had left,
the doors had closed and the train had started to move,

28
00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:05.720
then the next stop was West Berlin.

29
00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.200
And all those who were fleeing were safe.

30
00:03:11.648 --> 00:03:14.240
A policeman came, looked at my brother and said:

31
00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:18.360
“You were on the train this morning already,
what are you doing here?”

32
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.640
It was suspicious to go back and forth on the same morning.

33
00:03:22.658 --> 00:03:26.080
My brother had the presence of mind to say:

34
00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:29.240
“My mother is in Brandenburg,
I had to bring her something.”

35
00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:33.200
The policeman just said: “Step outside.”

36
00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:36.280
My brother had to get out with him.

37
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.200
And the doors closed,
the train left and the next stop was the West.

38
00:03:43.114 --> 00:03:48.360
It was such a terrible moment –
we were in the West, my brother was in the East.

39
00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:03.200
They questioned him for hours,
but my brother stuck to his story.

40
00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:07.680
I don’t know where he took that stubbornness.

41
00:04:08.128 --> 00:04:12.880
He said: “My mother is in Brandenburg,
I had to bring her her slippers, her sewing, her apron,

42
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.680
what would a 15-year-old do with that kind of stuff?”

43
00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:20.520
A young policeman said:
“Let’s just let him go, he’s just a boy.”

44
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.120
The other one said: “Alright, beat it,
but don’t let us catch you on this train line again.”

45
00:04:26.546 --> 00:04:31.840
My brother left and got onto the next train to the West.

46
00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:36.560
We were standing on the platform and he got out,
there he was.

47
00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:39.720
It was an incredible moment.

48
00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:44.880
We were in the West, we were free and safe,
all three of us were together.

49
00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:49.280
My mother could never have left my brother behind

50
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.800
but she probably would have gone to jail for several years
for fleeing the GDR.

51
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.800
Then we came to Marienfelde,
the refugee transit camp.

52
00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:12.240
That was the first shock for me.

53
00:05:13.573 --> 00:05:19.520
There was a room with iron beds, rough grey blankets,

54
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.520
a table with three chairs and nothing else.

55
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.880
I felt terrible that we had to sleep there.

56
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.672
My mother felt the same,

57
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.360
she looked at the stained blankets and said:
“My God, I can’t sleep in those.”

58
00:05:36.408 --> 00:05:40.920
The worst was in Neuss, where we were in a big hall

59
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.680
that was only subdivided by 2-metre-high plywood walls.

60
00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:51.080
You could hear everything.

61
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:56.920
At that time I just wanted to go home.

62
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.960
But home no longer existed.

63
00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:07.040
This break of just leaving without saying goodbye,

64
00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:13.240
knowing my seat in the classroom would be empty the next day,

65
00:06:15.034 --> 00:06:18.600
being torn away so brutally

66
00:06:19.773 --> 00:06:22.280
has been a lifelong process.

67
00:06:37.032 --> 00:06:42.240
When I later thought back to Berlin and my old home,

68
00:06:42.896 --> 00:06:49.440
“Tempelhof” to me was always the airport through which we flew to freedom.

69
00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:57.560
When it was due to be closed
and there was all the talk about what to do with it

70
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.680
it did make me a bit melancholic
to think that our airport no longer existed.

71
00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.987
Tempelhof always had a certain fascination.

72
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.640
When I see this field now, I think:

73
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.760
This is wonderful, it’s green, it’s spacious,

74
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.440
I hope they leave it like that.
